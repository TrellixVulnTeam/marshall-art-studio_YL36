        <h1>Defining the ACORD Simplified Data Model</h1>
        <p>The main technique in the ACORD&#160;simplified data model involves extending the ACORD schema for those ACORD&#160;complex types that are the pain points in your application or, in other words, involve those aggregates that contain fields that would require special field handling if you were still using the standard ACORD&#160;data model.</p>
        <p>Refer to the following guiding principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">First, concentrate on those ACORD&#160;aggregates that are foreign to the aggregate context found in your roster source configurations.</li>
            <li value="2">Although foreign aggregate "elimination" will dominate this task, don't limit yourself to just this aspect of the problem domain. With exception of index management responsibilities, which is not relevant in this task, also consider eliminating SFHs for fields with peculiarities of their own. Refer to the <a href="Field Helper Functionality.htm">Description of Existing Special Field Helper Functionality</a> section for more information.</li>
            <li value="3">Most of the scenarios detailed in the Description of Existing Field Helper Functionality section deal with fields whose XPath qualifying predicates are dynamically related to some other field value on the page that can change. An example of this is the <b>BlanketInfo</b> aggregate. Refer to the BlanketInfo section for a detailed explanation of this type of challenge.</li>
            <li value="4">The original standard ACORD homes for these aggregates must remain intact so that the same schema can support both simplified and standard ACORD&#160;representations at the same time.</li>
            <li value="5">If you find that you still need a number of SFHs, even after your remodeling effort, then take that model into question.</li>
            <li value="6">The expression of your application's ACORD&#160;simplified data model should be accomplished using schema extensions <u>in your own application schema</u>. Making direct updates to either the ACORD&#160;or the AgencyPortal template schema files (or ap_acord_simplified.xsd) is not an approved technique for modifying any of the ACORD&#160;entities.</li>
            <li value="7">Product development offers their expertise to review your application's simplified data model as part of the vetting process.</li>
            <li value="8">DO NOT advance to any further steps in this portion of the guide until you are totally satisfied with the simplified model you have crafted. Remodeling iterations are fine as long as TDF path changes are not involved. Vetting out the design of the simplified model should be taken seriously. You want your ACORD simplified finalized before applying those new XPaths as part of your application's TDF.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At this time, only one of the ACORD&#160;templates had been modified to adopt the ACORD simplified data model: the workers comp LOB template application. Unless the LOB for application is workers comp, you cannot fully leverage these exact modeling efforts for this application. </p>
        <p>Even though only one template application has been modified to support ACORD simplification, it is important to point out that some mindshare has been given to a couple of other ACORD&#160;simplifications outside of the workers comp realm. You may be able to leverage some of this modeling effort either in concept or content. The modeling work referred to in subsequent sections is contained in the apacord.jar file that is part of the SDK distribution zip.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/sdk zip.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>The apacord.jar file contains a number of schemas. The schema within this jar to refer to is ap_acord_simplified.xsd.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/ap_acord_simplified.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>The modeling in this schema relates to the <i>CommlSubLocation</i> aggregate.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/commlsublocation_typemodel.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>The modeling effort illustrated in the above diagram permits the <i>CommlPrpertyInfo</i>, <i>GlassSignInfo</i>, <i>GeneralLiabilityClassifications</i> and <i>SubLocation</i> aggregates to be valid children of the <i>CommlSubLocation</i> parent aggregate. This eliminates the need for any special field helpers for TDF fields that would historically be required to maintain the foreign aggregate relationships under the ACORD standard model. Moreover, this technique will permit "standard" AgencyPortal declarative field ID notation to be adopted for many of the fields contained in these aggregates.</p>
        <p>Consider the above model an illustration of the technique; the modeling discussions you make can vary.</p>
