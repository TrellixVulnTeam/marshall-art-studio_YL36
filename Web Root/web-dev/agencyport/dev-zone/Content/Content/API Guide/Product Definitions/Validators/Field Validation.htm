        <h1>Field Validation</h1>
        <p>Within the AgencyPortal framework, field validations are expressed within the transaction definition file, giving TDF authors the ability to directly express zero to many validation rules for a given field. AgencyPortal field validations have a client-side implementation written in JavaScript, as well as a server-side implementation written in Java.</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">The client-side implementation of field validations in AgencyPortal is designed to give the end user instant feed back if he/she has entered invalid data in a field on the screen. Page submission is prevented until data on the page is well formed per its expressed validation rules. Client-side field validations are intended to enhance the user's experience within the AgencyPortal application and has been explicitly architected not to inhibit the user's ability to do work within the application.</li>
            <li value="2">The server-side field validations are implemented for the purposes of a final-check of the data from within the controlled server-operating environment to ensure that corrupt or invalid data is not inadvertently committed to the data store.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The intent of the field validation engine is to provide a lightweight, user-friendly mechanism for simple validation rules. The field validation engine, and the validation rules implemented within it, are simple in nature and are designed only to address a finite number of common validation routines.</p>
        <p>The scope of the methods implemented within the validation is limited to individual fields. Cross-field validation (i.e., validation rules that take into account more than one field) is not inherently supported by the validation engine. (However, there is no reason a custom validator cannot be written to perform cross-field validation programmatically.)</p>
        <p>A common Java interface is published, which supports server side validations, both build-ins, as well as user-defined. The implementations of this interface built into the product as pre-canned validation components adheres to the stateless design to reduce the number of built-in object creations required on a per page per thread basis.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">The field validation infrastructure is not a field formatting one. Field validations enforce formats, but leave the task of actually updating the field to the end user or to custom Javascript.</p>
        <p>The order in which server side validations are fired will follow the field element order configured on a given TDF page.</p>
        <p>Validations are only fired for fields that are present in the HTMLDataContainer unless the field element is one of the following types:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">question</li>
            <li value="2">radio</li>
            <li value="3">selectlist</li>
            <li value="4">filterlist</li>
        </ul>
