Since most of us use different browsers and platforms, finding that feature isn't always so easy. 	Here, then, are instructions for the most popular browser/platform combinations:<p>	<b>Macintosh (OS 8 or later)</b><br>	Internet Explorer (4.0 or later) Print dialog box. From the button marked "General", 	pull down to "Internet Explorer." Check box next to "Print Background." Click "Print."<p>		Netscape (4.5 or later) From top menu bar, go to "File" down to "Page Setup ..." From there, 	pull down from the "Page Attributes" button to "Netscape Communicator." Check box next to "Print backgrounds." 	Click "OK."<p>		<b>PC (Windows 98 or later)</b><br>	Internet Explorer (4.0 or later) From top menu bar, go from "Tools" down to "Internet Options..." 	From there, go to top horizontal tab called "Advanced." Once there, scroll down to "Printing" and check 	box next to "Print background colors and images."  Click "OK."<p>		Netscape (4.5 or later) From top menu bar, go from "File" down to "Page Setup ..." In the "Page Options" 	section of the Page Setup window, check box next to "Print backgrounds." Click "OK."<p>		Also, since this is a fairly wide page, be sure to change your Print Orientation to "Wide" or "Landscape."	</div></td></tr></table></body></html>
