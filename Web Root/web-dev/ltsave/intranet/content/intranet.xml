			<p>To reboot the phone system:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Pull the plug on Units 1 and 2 in the equipment closet.  They are the flat units near the wall mounted modem.</li>
				<li>Check the white and grey cables between Units 1 and 2</li>
				<li>Push in both power plugs at the same time.</li>
				<li>Wait for about a minute.  Unit 1 will announce the current time.</li>
				<li>Optionally, run self-test by pushing the red button on Unit 1.  It checks dial-tone (quick), phone line quality (takes a couple of minutes), and rings each of the extensions.</li>

				<li>To reset an extension to factor defaults, dial 1-2 and the extension number</li>
				<li>If 'Invalid Extension', reboot the phone system.  Unit 1 has extensions 201-208, Unit 2 has extensions 209-216, Virtual extensions are 251-264</li>

			<p>LTSave employees that have necessary permissions can connect to LTSave's LAN (office network) and their workstations from anywhere in the Internet.  To have remote access enabled, please contact an administrator.</p>
			<p>There are two levels of remote connection:</p>
			<p><b>1st level - connection to the office LAN (VPN)</b>.  It enables you to browse and edit files on Master and other computers on the LAN. It also allows to print documents located on your remote computer to a printer in the office.</p>
			<p><b>2nd level - connection to a workstation in the office (RDP)</b>. There might be an application installed on your workstation that you need to use.  Therefore, you need to login to your workstation.</p>
			<p>Please use the following links to learn how to establish a remote connection:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Domain Users - needed for all users on a domain</li>
				<li>LTSave Groups\VPN Users - add to enable user to connect remotely using VPN.</li>
				<li>Remote Desktop Users - add to enable user to logon remotely via RDP. Please note, that VPN connection is required in order to establish a RDP connection.</li>
				<li>LTSave Groups\Wireless Users - add to enable a user to connect to LTSave's wireless network.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Note:</b> If domain isn't listed in Locations..., then check DNS for LAN.  It must point to DC server for primary DNS.</p>

		<item id="dc-migrate-user" title="How to migrate a user account from Workgroup to Domain">
			<p>The first thing thathas to be done in order to transfer a user's Workgroup profile to a Domain account is for Domain Administrator to create a new user's account on Domain Controller (DC). Please read <iref item="dc-create">how this has to be done</iref>.</p> <p>Next, follow these steps:</p>

				<li>Manually copy current outlook.pst to domain user's directory. ("%userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\*.pst")</li>

			<p>Syan stores backups in d:/backups. The primary directories are "d:/backups/Syan DB" for databases and d:/backups/Syan for archives.  See  <iref p4="//main/2005/road/setup/syan/README-backup.txt"/>.   Archives are in zip format with a zzip extension (prevents internel access by Windows explorer). The backup files are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Master-all-2004-12-22.zzip -- All files on \\Master\LTSaveDrive, including the Bugzilla backup in LTSaveDrive/Barber</li>
				<li>Master-2004-12-22-to-2005-09-21.zzip -- All updated files on \\Master\LTSaveDrive.  Must be less than 4 GBytes.</li>
				<li>Perforce-all-2005-09-22.zzip -- Perforce depot and checkpoint</li>
				<li>New-Master-P4-2005-10-10.zzip -- Recently modified files in Perforce and LTSaveDrive.  The start date is in master-all-date.txt.</li>
				<li>Other large files from LTSaveDrive, for example, Larry's backup file.   Review the incremental file if it suddenly becomes to big.</li>
			</ul>
      
			<p>Periodicially do the following</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Check /d/backups/Syan.  There should be new backups everyday.  If not, check the Application event log.  The back-new event should explain the reason.  For example, access to LTSaveDrive (/z) may need renewal via Windows Explorer.</li>
				<li>Use 'df' to check disk space on Syan and /e (the REV drive).   If more than 90% full, you need to clean up the backups.  Also delete old /d/Perforce/journal files.</li>
				<li>If the zzip files are larger than a gig or so, run 'back-master' and 'back-perforce' from  //main/2005/road/cygwin/usr/local/bin.   These create new full backups on Syan and the REV drive.</li>
				<li>Rotate the REV drives once every week.  There should always be two REV drives off-site.   Check that there is enough room on the REV drive.  Make sure that the recent full backups are on the drive (Perforce-all, Master-2004-12-22-to-2005..., and Master-all).  Cull old files as needed.</li>
				<li>Consider copying a Zip file of //main/2005/product/... and Syan/LTDev offsite every night.  Also check the backup and diskspace every day.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To recover from backup</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Move /d/Perforce/depots to depots-old</li>
				<li>Move /c/Perforce/journal to /d/Perforce/journal-recent.txt</li>
				<li>Delete all db.* files</li>
				<li>Install the Perforce server into /d/Perforce</li>
				<li>Extract the latest Perforce-all....zzip file into /d/Perforce/depots</li>
				<li>Extract the recent Peforce/depot files from New-Master-P4....zzip</li>
				<li>Check spelling of /d/Perforce/depots and check for /d/Perforce/depots/checkpoint.txt</li>
				<li>Check the date of depots/checkpoint.txt.  Find all /d/Perforce/journal*.gz files at least an hour younger.   Along with journal-recent.txt, these contain the journal entries since the last backup.</li>
				<li>Execute -- p4d -jr depots/checkpoint.txt</li>
				<li>On the recent journal archives, execute -- p4d -jr -z journal...</li>
				<li>Then execute -- p4d -jr journal-recent.txt</li>
				<li>Verify your work by executing -- p4 verify -q //...#1,#1</li>
				<li>The verify should complain about all files submitted after the last backup. Rotate the REV drives once every week.  There should always be two REV drives off-site.   Check that there is enough room on the REV drive.  Make sure that the recent full backups are on the drive (Perforce-all, Master-2004-12-22-to-2005..., and Master-all).  Cull old files as needed.</li>

			<p>It would be great to implement nav menu as a tree, so it could have an unlimited (or limited to 5-6 levels) depth.</p>
			<p>Also, it would be great to keep all section one after another, without the "More Topics" part.  Lets say we have
			<b>LTSave FAQ</b>, <b>Dev FAQ</b>, and <b>Software FAQ</b>, each containing items.  All sections would be collapsed at
			first, making it easy to see what's available. A user can then expand any of the sections to view their contents.</p>
			<p>This is how a nav menu is implemented on many sites, including a great resource - <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com" target="_blank">MSDN Library</a>.</p>
