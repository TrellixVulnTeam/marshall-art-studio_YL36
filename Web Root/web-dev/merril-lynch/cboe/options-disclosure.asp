As of the date of this booklet, options are traded onthe United States markets listed and on the European Options Exchangein Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In the future, options may be tradedon other markets within or outside the United States. The marketson which options are traded at any given time are referred toin this booklet as the &quot;options markets.&quot;<P>OCC is a registered clearing agency, and each U.S. options marketis a national securities exchange, that is subject to regulationby the Securities and Exchange Commission (&quot;SEC&quot;) underthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Foreign options markets,and their members, are not generally subject to regulation bythe SEC or to the requirements of the securities or other lawsof the U.S. and may not be subject to the jurisdiction of U.S.courts.<P><I>What is an option?</I> An option is the right either to buyor to sell a specified amount or value of a particular underlyinginterest at a fixed exercise price by exercising the option beforeits specified expiration date. An option which gives a right tobuy is a call option, and an option which gives a right to sellis a put option. Calls and puts are distinct types of options,and the buying or selling of one type does not involve the other.<P><I>EXAMPLE: </I>An option to buy 100 shares of common stock ofthe XYZ Corporation at a specified exercise price would be anXYZ call option. An option to sell 100 shares of common stockof the XYZ Corporation at a specified exercise price would bean XYZ put option.<P>There are two different kinds of options,  physical delivery optionsand cash-settled options. A physical delivery option gives itsowner the right to receive physical delivery (if it is a call),or to make physical delivery (if it is a put), of the underlyinginterest when the option is exercised. A cash-settled option givesits owner the right to receive a cash payment based on thedifference between a determined value of the underlying interestat the time the option is exercised and the fixed exercise priceof the option. A cash-settled call conveys the right to receivea cash payment if the determined value of the underlying interestat exercise-this value is known as the exercise settlement value-exceedsthe exercise price of the option, and a cash-settled put conveysthe right to receive a cash payment if the exercise settlementvalue is less than the exercise price of the option.<P>Each options market selects the underlying interests on whichoptions are traded on that market. Options are currently availablecovering four types of underlying interests: equity securities,stock indexes, government debt securities, and foreign currencies.Options on other types of underlying interests may become availablein the future.<P>Most options have standardized terms-such as the nature and amountof the underlying interest, the expiration date, the exerciseprice, whether the option is a call or a put, whether the optionis a physical delivery option or a cash-settled option, the mannerin which the cash payment and the exercise settlement value ofa cash-settled option are determined, the multiplier of a cash-settledoption, the style of the option, whether the option has automaticexercise provisions, and adjustment provisions. These standardizedterms are generally described in<A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd2"> Chapter II</A>. Each U.S. optionsmarket publishes specification sheets setting forth the particularstandardized terms of the options traded <I>on </I>that optionsmarket. (The options markets may also provide for trading in optionswhose terms are not all fixed in advance. Rather, subject to certainlimitations, the parties to transactions in these options maydesignate certain of the terms. These flexibly structured optionsare discussed in<A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd7"> Chapter VII</A> of this booklet.)<P>Options having the same standardized terms are identical and comprisean options series. The standardization of terms makes it morelikely that there will be a secondary market in which holdersand writers of options can close out their positions by offsettingsales and purchases. By selling an option of the same series asthe one he bought, or buying an option of the same series as theone he wrote, an investor can close out his position in that optionat any time there is a functioning secondary options market inoptions of that series.<P>In some instances, options of the same series may be traded onmore than one options market at the same time. Optionsthat are so traded are called multiply-traded options. Optionstraded on a U.S. options market may also be traded on a foreignoptions market. These options are referred to as internationally-traded options.  Multiply-traded and internationally-tradedoptions can ordinarily be purchased and written, and positionsin these options can ordinarily be liquidated in offsetting closingtransactions, in any of the options markets in which the optionsare traded. However, because premiums are affected by market forces,the premiums for identical multiply-traded or internationally-tradedoptions may not be the same in all markets at any given time.<P>If an options market learns that a particular underlying interestno longer meets its requirements for options trading or is noteligible for trading in all U.S. jurisdictions, or if an optionsmarket decides to discontinue trading in a particular optionsseries for another reason, the options market may stop introducingnew options on that underlying interest and may in certain circumstancesimpose restrictions on transactions that open new positions inoptions series that have been previously introduced, althoughtrading in the options series will ordinarily continue on at leastone options market until its expiration.<P>Options generally are traded on U.S. options markets during normalday-time business hours of U.S. securities exchanges and for ashort period afterward. However, trading in options may not beconfined to those hours. Trading in evening and night tradingsessions occurs in options on foreign currencies and may in thefuture occur in other types of options. Moreover, when there areunusual market conditions, an options market may authorize tradingto continue for a substantially longer period than under normalconditions. Trading in an expiring option may close at an earliertime than trading in other options.  Trading hours for optionsare also subject to change from time to time.  Readers should ascertain the trading hours of the particular options they areinterested in trading from the options markets where those optionsare traded. Readers should also be aware that trading in underlyinginterests is not confined to normal exchange trading hours. Forexample, underlying foreign currencies and debt securities aretraded in international markets on virtually an around-the-clockbasis, and underlying equity securities may be traded in foreignmarkets when U.S. markets are closed and in some U.S. marketsafter the close of their normal trading hours. <P>Readers shouldbe aware that this booklet has been written to meet the requirementsof an SEC rule that requires the U.S. options markets to prepare,and brokerage firms to distribute, a booklet that briefly andgenerally describes the characteristics of options and the risksto investors of maintaining positions in options. Options areversatile instruments that can be used in a wide variety of investmentstrategies. They give the investor the ability to create positionsthat reflect the investor's opinion of an underlying interestand to select investment strategies that reflect the investor'stolerance for risk. This booklet is not designed to describethe various potential benefits of options or how investors mayuse options to enhance their investment strategies or to reducerisk. Numerous other publications, including some prepared bythe U.S. options markets that are available upon request, containdiscussions of the uses and potential benefits of options andof the various trading and investment strategies that can be employedwith options. Readers who wish to balance the general discussionof risks that is contained in this booklet with a discussionof options uses, benefits and strategies should consult one ormore of these other publications.<P>Readers should read and understand this booklet in its entirety,since a number of the separate chapters will be relevant to everyreader interested in buying or writing options. For example, areader who is interested in options on equity securities shouldfully read not only<A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd3"> Chapter III</A>, but also should read <A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd2"> Chapters II</A>, <A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd8">VIII</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd9">IX</A>, as well as the discussion of risks in <A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd10">Chapter X</A>. Readers should also be aware that, although this booklet seeksto describe the various characteristics of options and the risksthat are unique to being an investor in options, there are manymatters which are beyond the scope of this booklet that are notdiscussed.<A HREF="http://www.cboe.com/otec/ML/education.asp?cid=odd11"> Chapter Xl</A> contains a discussion of the scope and limitations of this booklet.		</span>		</div>		</td>	</tr></table></body></html>
