Classes and seminars for individual        investors, retail brokers, institutional investors and Federal and State        securities regulators are offered on a regular basis.<br><br>As        options products evolve and expand to meet a growing number of        investment scenarios, The Options Institute's role in providing        quality options education continues to grow. It has become a widely used        industry resource, conducting seminars worldwide that both answer        continuing education requirements and stimulate the effective use of        options among diverse segments of the investing community. Courses are        designed to teach participants how to meet their investment goals and        include topics ranging from the basics of options to uses of advanced        strategies.<br><br>A comprehensive curriculum, taught by trading        industry professionals, covers all phases of the options business - from        understanding options to using options to managing client accounts.        Theory, strategy and hands-on trading simulations combine for an        exceptional experience.<br><br>One of the most effective resources        available to The Options Institute is the trading floor of the Chicago        Board Options Exchange and its members. Mock trading sessions held on        the floor of the exchange provide class participants with firsthand        experience in how options are traded and enhance their knowledge of the        industry.<br><br>Evaluation of course content and effectiveness is an        integral part of the Institute's educational philosophy.        Participant feedback is a major consideration in our course revisions        and long-term curriculum development.<br><br>Learning about options is        one thing; knowing how to use them is another. The Institute, created to        address the needs of retail brokers as well as individual and        professional options users, continues to offer a curriculum that        enlightens and challenges participants. The Options Institute bridges        the gap between theory and practice by combining lecture and seminar        sessions to bring an otherwise esoteric subject directly to bear in the        individual's areas of need. To accomplish this goal, several        different types of programs have been created, each with the idea of        helping a particular segment of the industry learn just how options can        be an appropriate and useful tool for their investment and risk        management objectives.<br><br><a HREF="#top"><img SRC="/graphics/top2.gif" ALT="Top" WIDTH="40" HEIGHT="34" ALIGN="RIGHT" BORDER="0"></a></td>      </tr>    </table>		</span>		</div>		</td>	</tr></table></body></html>
