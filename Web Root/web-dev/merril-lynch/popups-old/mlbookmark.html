The concept was created by brainstorming with the client. I provided the visual design, the illustration and font-color treatment. In addition, I also researched the quote sources and formatted the Quantumn Books logo into vector are by backwards-engineering. Both Quantumn and Merrill Lynch were pleased with the end results.</p>		</div>	</div></body></html>
